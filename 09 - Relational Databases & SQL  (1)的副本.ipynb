    "In the above, we've used a database known as [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) -- a database which is both extremely common, available in the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html), extrememly easy to set up, and nonetheless extremely powerful. `sqlite` stores the data we've put in it in a single file we've seen above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst each database will have a slightly different _dialect_ of SQL (meaning it will vary slightly), you will likely find more commonalities between SQL dialects than differences, certainly amongst queries like `SELECT`ing data for analysis, so porting your knowledge to a new relational database is usually relatively straightforward. Nevertheless, holding the nuances or small differences between each in your head can be challenging, so it's OK to just re-learn the differences when presented with a different database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three particular databases worth mentioning because of their ubiquity are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) -- an extremely common advanced, open source relational database\n",
    "* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) -- another similar open source relational database\n",
    "* [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) -- technically not a database, moreso a data warehouse with a SQL query engine on top -- meaning a company you work for may store lots of their data somewhere within Google Cloud and then make you be able to run similar queries to the above in order to extract data from this warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try out BigQuery with the [public datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) that Google has made available. Specifically, here's one for [pubic PyPI download statistics](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=pypi&page=dataset) (where all the Python packages are stored; here are some [docs](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/) too).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also databases which are known as non-relational, whose structure does not necessarily deal with entities or tables that are related to other entities and joins between them. If you are interested in learning more about databases more broadly, you may find the [Seven Databases in Seven Days book](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Databases-Weeks-Modern-Movement/dp/1934356921) interesting."
